\section{Hard Problems}
\label{sec:orgbdc091a}
Many problems have polynomial \(O(n^k)\) time solutions.
Some problems haven't had a polynomial time solution.

\section{Complexity Classes}
\label{sec:org485cc46}
\begin{description}
\item[{P}] Set of problems we can solve in polynomial time. Sorting, Searching\ldots{}
\item[{NP}] Verifiable in polynomial time. If you can solve in polynomial time, you can verify in polynomial time, but it's not always true in the other direction.
\item[{NP-Complete}] Set of problems that \uline{ANY} problem in NP can be transformed into in polynomial time. Decision.
\item[{NP-Hard}] At least as hard as hard as hard as hard as any problem in NP. Optimization.
\end{description}

\section{P vs NP}
\label{sec:org9202355}
P = NP? If you can find a polynomial solution in NP-Complete, then you can transform any NP problem into NP-Complete in polynomial time and then solve it. So if you can prove P = NP you're a genius millionare.

\section{NP-Complete Problems}
\label{sec:org52b0db7}
\subsection{Boolean Satisfiability}
\label{sec:org012e579}
kCNF (k Conjunctive Normal Form) - A way to express a logical statement. Each or has exactly k variables.
\begin{itemize}
\item "AND" of many "OR" expressions, each of which contains K variables or their negations.
\item (P || !Q) \&\& (R || Q) \&\& (!P || !R) - 2 CNF because each or has 2 variables.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{kSAT}
\label{sec:org2abd563}
Given an expression in KCNF is there an assignment of vars that makes it evaluate to true. \\
k = 2 (2SAT) \(\epsilon\) P \\
k > 2 \(\epsilon\) NP-Complete
